step to perform the analysis:

1. produce the daily data with:  producedailydata.py
   - combines the data and simulation and split the data set into separated days

2. find by eye the good day and list them in a file called "nameofthestation.txt"
   look at the data with selectsdata.py
   look at the selected data with plotselectedsdata.py
   the list is in /GD_Tsys/list/   

3. find the temperature dependence with tempparam.py
   - will select the data without sun and find the linear relation between the radio baseline and the temperature
   - will write the fit result if option "-save"

4. fit the sun bump and compute the system temperature with fitradio.py
   - corrects for the temperature dependence
   - fit with a gaussian
   - computes the error on each measurement
   - computes the weighted mean and error
